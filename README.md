## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### **Environment Variables Setup**
Before deploying, you'll need to set up the following environment variables:

```bash
# Set your Google Cloud project ID
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"

# Set your preferred region
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="us-central1"

# Set your service name
export SERVICE_NAME="stock-analyzer-service"

# Set your app name
export APP_NAME="stock-analyzer"

# Set the path to your agent file
export AGENT_PATH="./agent.py"
```

### **Deploy to Cloud Run**
Use the following command to deploy your multi-agent stock analyzer to Google Cloud Run:

```bash
sudo adk deploy cloud_run \
--project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
--region=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
--service_name=$SERVICE_NAME \
--app_name=$APP_NAME \
--with_ui \
$AGENT_PATH
```

### **Post-Deployment**
After successful deployment:
1. You'll receive a public URL for your deployed service
2. The `--with_ui` flag enables a web interface for easy interaction
3. Test your deployment by accessing the provided URL
4. Monitor your service in the Google Cloud Console
